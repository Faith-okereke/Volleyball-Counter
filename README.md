A VOlleyball Game Point tracker.

This is a simple website to update points during a volleyball game. This website can be used by the umpire to ease the count and keep up with it while focusing on the game to find fouls.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Add and remove points based on the situation of the game
- View the scores at the end of the game
- Proceed to a next game round
